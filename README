% The following nest of folders contain the MATLAB code used within my Thesis 
%for solving the 2D Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions 
%via either an indirect or direct boundary integral formulation. 

%For any questions please email me at: jacob.rowbottom2017@my.ntu.ac.uk

%Please copy the Raw data from the corresponding files you wish to use and
%save as mfiles with the same names as the ones labelled here.

% Within the Indirect BEM folder contains the code for solving the
% Helmholtz via the indirect BEM with either the Galerkin or the
% Collocation discretisation method as shown by the subfolders. For each
% Collcoation and Galerkin subfolder the discretisation methods are solved using either 
%piecewise Constant or piecewise Linear basis functions as shown by the subsubfolders. Finally, within each
%constant or linear basis function subsubfolder contain the code for
%solving for the case when the domain is either a polygon or a circle.

%In each folder contains the Main Script file, named MainScript. The other files are the function files used within
%each Script file. Each MainScript contains an annotated script file which
%explains which each variable is computing.

%Within the Direct BEM folder contains the code for solving the
% Helmholtz via the direct BEM with a collocation method with piecewise constant
% basis functions. This contains the Main Script file, named MainScript. The other files are the function files used within
%each Script file. The MainScript contains an annotated script file which
%explains which each variable is computing. The MainScript file is set up
%to solve for the case when there is a source point excitation inside the
%domain or for the case when there are Neumann Boundayr conditions. 

%For the case when there is a Neumann Boundary condition simply run the
%code up to Stage 2. 
%For the case when there is a source point inside the domain run the
%complete code. For the L-shape domain comment out the code in the MainScript file and inside the
%PointSourceNum file where specified

%For further understanding of the methodolgy behind the code we refer the
%reader to Chapter 2 of my Thesis where it is discussed in greater detail.
%For further understanding of the key equations requid to solve for each
%method we refer the reader to  Figure 2.3 of my Thesis.
